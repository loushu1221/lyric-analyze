Imagine (Live)
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
No religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
And you you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
