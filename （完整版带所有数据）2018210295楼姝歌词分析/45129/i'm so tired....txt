I’m so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs
Tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

Party, trying  my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
Hate it, taking a shot cause I can’t take it
But I don’t think they make anything that strong so I hold on

I’m so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs
Tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers

And when they leave I go back to our song, I hold on
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut season like you’re still around
Can’t unmiss you and I need you now

I’m so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs
Tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I’m so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs (someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home (cause I can’t be alone)
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs
Tired of love songs (I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home
Wanna go home
Wanna go home, woahi'm so tired...
