for him.
Nonefor him.
We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack, you make up
We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump starting your car cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clich¨¦s on our own little tour
Let's ride
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you
We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you

Eat a pill stay and chill you don't needa go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a tv show
Then ill squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We canna get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break my lil heart, it¡¯d be an honour
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is youfor him.
